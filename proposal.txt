Here is the template to get started.

Project Proposal
Use this template to help get you started right away! 

---This will be an app and website that allows users to search for nearby playgrounds based on their current location. Users also can also filter their search for specific needs, upload playground info, save parks to custom folders.. This application will use a free API to fetch playground location data and amenities.	

Stack Focus	Is the front-end UI or the back-end going to be the focus of your project? Or are you going to make an evenly focused full-stack application?

---It will be a full-stack application using React and Node.js for the front end, and Express with PostgreSQL for the backend.

Type: Will this be a website? A mobile app? Something else?

---This will be a mobile app as well as desktop site.

Goal:What goal will your project be designed to achieve?

---The goal is to provide an accurate and concise way for parents to locate nearby playgrounds that fit their needs when traveling with children.  	

Users:What kind of users will visit your app? In other words, what is the demographic of your users?

---The demographic includes parents, grandparents, babysitters and other caregivers.	

Data:What data do you plan on using? How are you planning on collecting your data? You may have not picked your actual API yet, which is fine, just outline what kind of data you would like it to contain. You are welcome to create your own API and populate it with data. 

---In this app I will be using the Google Maps Places API, and OpenStreetMap ApI to fetch geolocation data from users and locate nearby park names, photos, amenities and distance from user.
